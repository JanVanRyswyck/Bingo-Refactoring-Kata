Kata to show parallel change (introduce class Cell and class Coordinate): 
- introduce class Cell: Focus on parallel change on fields/internal data structure
- introduce class Coordinate: Focus on method signatures/API/compatible vs. breaking changes


Code smells: 
- Primitive obsession
- data clumps
- missing polymorphism (Board/InitializedBoard/...)

beside that code needs refactoring: 
- extract methods
