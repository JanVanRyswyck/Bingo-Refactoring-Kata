# Bingo Refactoring Kata

Can you spot the any code smells? We think you should be able to find

- Primitive Obsession
- Data Clumps
- Missing Polymorphism

Use Parallel Change to address this problem by introducing a Cell and Coordinate class.

First introduce the Cell class: focus on parallel change of the internal datastructure.

Second introduce the Coordinate class: focus on parallel change of the public API of the BingoBoard class.
